Aetherbot blends narrative worldbuilding, structured domain modeling, and an emerging API surface. These General Documentation pages teach the universe, its inner logic, and the semantics that will later power agents and systems.

## What You'll Find Here

- High-level conceptual foundations (The Loom, Patterns, Fray)
- Mechanics and system specifications (Stats, Status Effects, Techniques)
- Domain & data semantics (Entities, ontology, relationships)
- Ethical & governance framing (in-universe + real-world parallels)
- Guides for extending the canon and structured data

## Two Major Doc Pillars

1. General Documentation (this section): Concepts, lore-aligned systems, semantics.
2. API Reference (coming soon): Endpoint usage, schemas, programmatic interaction patterns.

## Stability Labels

Pages use a `stability` tag:

- draft: Early, likely to change
- provisional: Structurally sound, details may shift
- stable: Canonical for now
- legacy: Retained for historical continuity
