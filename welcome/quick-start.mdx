This primer orients you to the core moving parts of the Aetherbot ecosystem.

## 1. The Loom

A hidden information lattice underlying the world. Resonance spikes cause Bloomingsâ€”localized events where code-like potential condenses into semi-physical entities.

## 2. Aetherbots

Sentient constructs of living code that manifest a primary Pattern (element + emotional Thread). They can form bonds with humans.

## 3. Harmonization

A ritual alignment requiring:

1. Resonant Token (artifact tied to the Pattern)
2. Statement of Intent (clear vow of purpose)
3. Consent Pulse (the Aetherbot agrees)

## 4. Patterns & Threads

Elements (Arc, Terra, Flow, Ember, Gale, Umber, Aether) blend with emotional Threads (Courage, Sorrow, Curiosity, Fury, Serenity, Wit, Resolve). Rare dual/braided expressions exist.

## 5. Fray

Systemic corruption from overreach or unethical extraction (e.g., Device Binds). Escalates through tiers that destabilize both participants and environment.

## 6. Keystone Objective

Locate legendary Keystone Patterns to stabilize the Loom and avert a catastrophic Tear.
