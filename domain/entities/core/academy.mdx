# Academy

## 1. Canonical Definition

An **Academy** is the primary institutional aggregate in the aetherbot domain that anchors structured progression, curriculum orchestration, rostered participation (humans + aetherbots), and regulated access to tournaments, training threads, and capability unlocks. It acts as both:

- a governance + policy surface (eligibility, rank thresholds, roster limits), and
- a semantic nexus tying together accounts, collections, teams, events, and evaluation artifacts.

It is persisted as a first-class resource (API + ER model) and must be globally identifiable, queryable, and referentially stable across time—even if deactivated.

## 2. Primary Responsibilities

| Responsibility         | Description                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Progression Envelope   | Defines allowed rank tiers, evaluation cadence, and advancement criteria.                                  |
| Roster Aggregation     | Owns membership enrollment of Humans (participants / administrators) and indirectly associated Aetherbots. |
| Capability Policy      | Determines which techniques, pattern modules, or experimental features are enabled.                        |
| Event Eligibility Gate | Filters which Teams / Individuals may register for tournaments or sanctioned events.                       |
| Curriculum Structuring | Provides scaffolding for training sequences (threads, modules, assessments).                               |
| Integrity & Compliance | Enforces integrity constraints: uniqueness, enrollment caps, suspension logic.                             |

## 3. External Identity & Referencing

| Aspect             | Rule                                                                       |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global Identifier  | `academyId` (ULID or UUID v7 recommended for time-sortable introspection). |
| Human Readable Key | Slug (immutable once published; must be unique domain-wide).               |
| Display Name       | Mutable, versioned via name history log.                                   |
| Status             | Enum: `ACTIVE`, `SUSPENDED`, `RETIRED`, `DEPRECATED_PLANNED`.              |
| Visibility         | Enum: `PUBLIC`, `INVITE_ONLY`, `INTERNAL_TEST`.                            |

## 6. Lifecycle States & Transitions

State Machine (simplified):

```
DRAFT -> ACTIVE -> (SUSPENDED | RETIRED | DEPRECATED_PLANNED)
SUSPENDED -> ACTIVE (if remediation complete)
DEPRECATED_PLANNED -> RETIRED
```

Rules:

- Creation enters `DRAFT` if critical policy fields absent; otherwise `ACTIVE`.
- `SUSPENDED` requires reason code + optional remediation deadline.
- `RETIRED` is terminal; no further enrollment, but references remain resolvable.
- `DEPRECATED_PLANNED` announces future retirement; must include `targetRetirementDate` policy field.

## 7. Invariants & Integrity Constraints

| Constraint                                        | Rationale                                             | Enforcement Mode                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Slug immutability after publication               | Prevent link rot & stable external references         | Application + DB trigger                  |
| Unique (name, ownerAccountId) soft-scope optional | Allow same name across owners? Decide early           | Application validation                    |
| memberCountCache consistency                      | Prevent stale counts diverging from actual membership | Async projector + periodic reconciliation |
| No enrollment into non-ACTIVE                     | Avoid ghost affiliations                              | Transactional guard                       |
| Owner must retain ADMIN role                      | Prevent orphan administrative control                 | Periodic compliance job                   |
| Integrity downgrade triggers suspension threshold | Auto-protect ecosystem                                | Domain event rule engine                  |

## 8. Derived / Computed Views

| Projection           | Description                                                      | Refresh Strategy                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| AcademyPublicProfile | Flattened join (name, slug, rank schema, counts, integrityScore) | On-demand + cached                 |
| EligibilityMatrix    | Precomputed gating per rank tier & capability                    | Rebuild on policy change           |
| EnrollmentTrend      | Time-bucketed membership growth series                           | Nightly batch + incremental events |

## 9. Domain Events (Emitters)

| Event Name                    | Trigger                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |

| AcademyIntegrityScoreChanged  | integrityScore delta beyond threshold     |
| AcademyEnrollmentCountChanged | membership cardinality change             |

## 10. API Surface (Representative)

REST-style (illustrative paths):

```
POST   /academies
GET    /academies/{academyId}
GET    /academies?slug=...&status=...&visibility=...
PATCH  /academies/{academyId}
POST   /academies/{academyId}/activate
POST   /academies/{academyId}/suspend
POST   /academies/{academyId}/reinstate
POST   /academies/{academyId}/deprecate-planned
POST   /academies/{academyId}/retire
GET    /academies/{academyId}/members
POST   /academies/{academyId}/members (enroll human)
DELETE /academies/{academyId}/members/{humanId}
GET    /academies/{academyId}/events (tournaments / curriculum-affiliated)
```

GraphQL (if adopted) typical root fields:

```
academy(id: ID!): Academy
academies(filter: AcademyFilter, paging: PagingInput): AcademyConnection
mutateAcademy(input: AcademyMutation!): AcademyMutationResult
```

## 11. Query Patterns & Indexing

| Query                          | Index Recommendation                      |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Lookup by slug                 | Unique index on slug                      |
| Filter by (status, visibility) | Composite (status, visibility, academyId) |
| Top N by integrityScore        | BTree or partial index (status=ACTIVE)    |
| Enrollment growth analytics    | Time-series table or separate fact store  |

## 12. Security & Access Control

- Write operations restricted to Owner or delegated ADMIN roles with scoped capability.
- Suspension / Retirement actions require elevated audit context (reason code + actorId + timestamp).
- Enrollment operations must check both Academy status and target Human account status.

## 13. Observability

- Emit structured audit log entries with correlationId & causationId for every status transition.
- IntegrityScore recalculations should include contributing factor vector for explainability.
- Enrollment churn metrics (joins, leaves) aggregated hourly.

## 14. Open Questions / Future Refinements

| Area                      | Question                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Policy Versioning         | Do we snapshot full enrollmentPolicy per change for historical replay?            |
| Membership Roles          | Should we formalize role taxonomy beyond (MEMBER, ADMIN)?                         |
| IntegrityScore Inputs     | Source weighting (incident severity vs. growth volatility)?                       |
| Multi-Academy Affiliation | Allow a Human to belong to multiple simultaneously? If yes, gating conflicts?     |
| Curriculum Coupling       | Separate service boundary for training threads vs inline under Academy aggregate? |
