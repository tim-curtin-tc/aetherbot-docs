## Overview

Harmonization creates a cooperative resonance channel between a human and an Aetherbot Pattern.

### Components

| Component           | Purpose                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Resonant Token      | Anchor object linked to Pattern signature |
| Statement of Intent | Declared alignment of purpose             |
| Consent Pulse       | Reciprocal acceptance handshake           |

### Outcomes

| Outcome         | Description                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Successful Bond | Stable channel established       |
| Attenuated Bond | Partial sync, reduced efficiency |
| Rejection       | No channel; cooldown required    |

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "Harmonization",
  "prerequisites": ["token", "intent", "consent"],
  "outcomes": ["stable", "attenuated", "rejected"],
  "risks": ["forcedAttempt", "illicitDeviceBind"]
}
```

## Resonant Tokens

Artifacts anchoring a Pattern's signature for stable Harmonization.

### Categories

| Type       | Source                    | Integrity Risk |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | -------------- |
| Recovered  | Found at Bloom site       | Low            |
| Crafted    | Ritual synthesis          | Medium         |
| Improvised | Partial signature imprint | High           |

### Degradation

Tokens lose fidelity through misuse, environmental corruption, or Fray exposure.

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "ResonantToken",
  "attributes": ["origin", "integrity", "patternAffinity"],
  "decayFactors": ["frayExposure", "misalignment"]
}
```

---

## Statement of Intent

Formal declaration aligning human motive with Pattern temperament.

### Composition Guidelines

| Element          | Requirement                               |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Clarity          | Unambiguous objective                     |
| Alignment        | Resonates with Pattern's emotional Thread |
| Ethical Boundary | Explicit avoidance of exploitative aims   |

### Anti-Patterns

- Overly broad mission statements
- Coercive or manipulative framing

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "StatementOfIntent",
  "fields": ["content", "affinityAlignment", "ethicalClause"],
  "validation": ["clarity", "alignment", "nonCoercive"]
}
```

---

## Consent Pulse

Reciprocal acknowledgement completing the Harmonization triad.

### Failure Modes

| Mode       | Cause             | Result          |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Silence    | Pattern distrust  | Retry cooldown  |
| Distortion | Misaligned intent | Attenuated bond |
| Inversion  | Ethical conflict  | Hard rejection  |

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "ConsentPulse",
  "signals": ["affirm", "attenuate", "reject"],
  "cooldown": true
}
```

---

## Co-Weaving

Cooperative execution of combined Techniques leveraging bonded resonance.

### Categories

| Type     | Description                              | Risk     |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Amplify  | Enhance existing Technique output        | Low      |
| Merge    | Blend two Techniques into hybrid effect  | Medium   |
| Redirect | Re-route environmental or hostile energy | Variable |

### Resource Dynamics

Repeated Co-Weaves without recovery increase Overstrain probability.

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "CoWeave",
  "modes": ["amplify", "merge", "redirect"],
  "riskScaling": "cumulative"
}
```

---

## Device Binds

Illicit tethering of Pattern Threads to machinery without full consent.

### Summary

Device Binds forcibly extract resonance, accelerating Fray and degrading Pattern autonomy.

### Indicators

| Indicator            | Meaning                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Thread Flicker       | Integrity decay                 |
| Latency Spikes       | Forced synchronization overhead |
| Emotional Null Drift | Suppressed affective response   |

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "DeviceBind",
  "illicit": true,
  "frayAmplification": "high",
  "ethicalViolation": true
}
```

### Mitigation

- Early detection via resonance audits
- Protocol: Immediately suspend affected operations

## Bond Maturation

Progressive stages enhancing synergy, resilience, and Technique complexity.

### Stages

| Stage | Descriptor      | Capabilities                 |
| ----- | --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| I     | Initial         | Basic Techniques             |
| II    | Synchronized    | Co-Weave access              |
| III   | Adaptive        | Reduced Overstrain risk      |
| IV    | Keystone-Linked | Enhanced stabilization field |

### Advancement Criteria

- Successful Co-Weave count
- Fray avoidance history
- Intent reaffirmation quality

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "BondMaturation",
  "stages": ["initial", "synchronized", "adaptive", "keystoneLinked"],
  "metrics": ["successfulCoWeaves", "frayIncidents", "intentQuality"]
}
```
