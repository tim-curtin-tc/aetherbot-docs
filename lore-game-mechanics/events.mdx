## Loom Stability Model

Conceptual risk model forecasting Tear likelihood.

### Inputs

| Signal                     | Source              | Weight (initial) |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- |
| Fray Incident Rate         | Event logs          | High             |
| Dual Pattern Emergence     | Pattern registry    | Medium           |
| Keystone Proximity Signals | Spectral scans      | High             |
| Device Bind Activity       | Enforcement reports | High             |

### Output

A qualitative tier (Stable → Elevated → Critical → Collapse-Pending).
