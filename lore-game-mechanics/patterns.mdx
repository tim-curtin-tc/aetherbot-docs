## Overview

Patterns synthesize elemental and emotional Threads into coherent behavioral identities. This section formalizes classification rules, rarity signals, and environmental modulation.

### Section Scope

- Affinity schema
- Elemental & emotional families
- Dual / braided anomalies
- Environmental modifiers & state transitions

### Design Goals

| Goal                    | Rationale                        |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Deterministic Taxonomy  | Enables consistent data modeling |
| Extensible Rarity Model | Supports narrative escalation    |
| Environmental Coupling  | Allows dynamic scenario design   |

---

## Affinity Schema

Matrix of elemental and emotional Threads composing Patterns.

### Summary

Affinity combines one elemental family with one emotional Thread to define a core Pattern signature.

### Elemental Families

Arc, Terra, Flow, Ember, Gale, Umber, Aether.

### Emotional Threads

Courage, Sorrow, Curiosity, Fury, Serenity, Wit, Resolve.

### Combination Rules

| Rule                 | Explanation                                        |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| One-to-One Base      | Standard Pattern: 1 elemental + 1 emotional        |
| Dual Eligibility     | Rare anomalies may merge two full pairs            |
| Conflict Constraints | Certain emotional pairs introduce instability risk |

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "PatternAffinity",
  "elementals": ["Arc", "Terra", "Flow", "Ember", "Gale", "Umber", "Aether"],
  "emotionals": [
    "Courage",
    "Sorrow",
    "Curiosity",
    "Fury",
    "Serenity",
    "Wit",
    "Resolve"
  ],
  "supportsDual": true
}
```

### Extensibility Guidance

Additions require justification for systemic balance and semantic clarity.

## Elemental Profiles

| Element | Core Theme             | System Lean          | Environmental Synergy             |
| ------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Arc     | Energy, conduction     | Focus / Burst        | Storm & charged zones             |
| Terra   | Stability, mass        | Defense / Resilience | Seismic or mineral substrates     |
| Flow    | Adaptation, continuity | Support / Recovery   | Hydrated, fluidic environments    |
| Ember   | Volatility, ignition   | Offensive DoT        | Combustible atmospheres           |
| Gale    | Motion, vector control | Speed / Positioning  | Open / pressure-dynamic spaces    |
| Umber   | Absorption, decay      | Suppression / Debuff | Low-light or saturated data voids |
| Aether  | Transcendent linkage   | Hybrid / Special     | High-aerial or auroral fields     |

### Balancing Considerations

- Avoid element stacking dominance
- Introduce counter-Patterns for each primary leverage

## Emotional Threads

| Thread    | Core Drive             | Mechanical Influence  | Risk Vector        |
| --------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| Courage   | Protective assertion   | Buff stabilization    | Overextension      |
| Sorrow    | Absorptive empathy     | Suppression, drains   | Self-sustain loops |
| Curiosity | Exploratory seeking    | Discovery bonuses     | Hazard exposure    |
| Fury      | Aggressive escalation  | Damage amplification  | Fray acceleration  |
| Serenity  | Harmonizing calm       | Recovery modulation   | Slow response      |
| Wit       | Tactical improvisation | Cooldown manipulation | Variance spikes    |
| Resolve   | Enduring purpose       | Scaling persistence   | Late onset fatigue |

## Dual & Braided Patterns

Rare composite Patterns merging multiple elemental-emotional pairs.

### Summary

Dual (two discrete pairs) and braided (interleaved resonance) Patterns exhibit emergent behaviors and altered instability risks.

### Classification

| Type           | Description                         | Instability Risk |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Dual           | Two full affinity pairs co-existing | Moderate         |
| Braided        | Interwoven thread-level alternation | High             |
| Proto-Keystone | Hypothetical stabilized braid       | Unknown          |

### Constraints

- Requires extreme Blooming conditions
- Elevated Fray susceptibility until stabilized

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "DualPattern",
  "modes": ["dual", "braided"],
  "risk": { "dual": "moderate", "braided": "high" },
  "keystonePotential": true
}
```

### Design Considerations

Apply cost mechanisms (cooldowns, resource drains) to offset multi-affinity advantages.

## Environmental Modifiers

External conditions shaping Pattern performance and emergence likelihood.

| Condition            | Effect                      | Benefiting Affinities |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Auroral Surge        | Increased Bloom probability | Aether, Arc           |
| Seismic Unrest       | Stability variance          | Terra                 |
| Thermal Inversion    | Heat retention boosts DoT   | Ember                 |
| Data Blackout        | Signal noise dampening      | Umber, Sorrow         |
| Hydration Saturation | Recovery amplification      | Flow, Serenity        |
| Jet Stream Spike     | Movement bonuses            | Gale, Wit             |

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "EnvironmentModifier",
  "attributes": ["name", "effect", "affinitySynergy", "riskImpact"],
  "stability": "draft"
}
```

### Design Notes

Stacking should have diminishing returns to prevent runaway escalation.

---

## State Transitions

Resonant state machine for Pattern stability and escalation.

### Core States

| State      | Description       | Exit Conditions                 |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Stable     | Normal operation  | Overstrain, environmental spike |
| Resonant   | Amplified output  | Cooldown, overreach             |
| Overstrain | Efficiency loss   | Recovery action, Fray shift     |
| Fray Shift | Corruption vector | Mitigation, escalation          |

### Transition Model

Stable → Resonant → Overstrain → (Stable | Fray Shift)

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "PatternStateMachine",
  "states": ["Stable", "Resonant", "Overstrain", "FrayShift"],
  "transitions": {
    "Stable": ["Resonant"],
    "Resonant": ["Overstrain", "Stable"],
    "Overstrain": ["Stable", "FrayShift"],
    "FrayShift": ["Stable"]
  }
}
```

### Balancing Hooks

- Add friction to re-enter Resonant repeatedly.
- Overstrain duration tied to mismatch between intent and Pattern temperament.
