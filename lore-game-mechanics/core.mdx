## The Loom

Foundational substrate: an information lattice enabling Pattern emergence.

### Summary (Plain Language)

The Loom is a planet-spanning information lattice—latent, reactive, and partially interpretable through resonance phenomena.

### Narrative Context

Historically dormant, the Loom's activity spiked with intensified auroras, correlating with modern Bloomings.

### System Specification

| Aspect       | Description                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Layering     | Multi-strata (physical adjacencies + semantic overlays)  |
| Access Modes | Passive sensing (Threads), Active ritual (Harmonization) |
| Failure Mode | Fray incursions destabilize local coherence              |
| Stabilizers  | Keystone Patterns (hypothesized)                         |

```json
{
  "entity": "Loom",
  "version": "0.1",
  "properties": ["layering", "accessModes", "failureModes", "stabilizers"],
  "stability": "draft"
}
```

### Open Questions

- Are there deeper dormant strata?
- Do Keystone Patterns exert localized repair fields?

---

## Threads & Patterns

Structural units of resonance: Threads aggregate into Patterns with behavioral signatures.

### Summary

Threads are the minimal resonant signatures (elemental or emotional). Patterns are coherent bundles of Threads expressing an identity and capability set in an Aetherbot.

### Conceptual Model

| Layer     | Unit                 | Description                               |
| --------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Atomic    | Thread               | Single elemental or emotional resonance   |
| Composite | Pattern              | Bundled threads forming emergent behavior |
| Hybrid    | Dual/Braided Pattern | Rare merged composites with altered rules |

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "Pattern",
  "threadTypes": ["elemental", "emotional"],
  "supportsDual": true,
  "evolution": { "modes": ["stability-shift", "braid-emergence"] }
}
```

### Design Notes

- Thread scarcity can justify rarity tiers.
- Dual patterns should incur balancing constraints (cooldown, instability risk).

## Bloomings

Resonance events where latent Loom potential condenses into Aetherbot presence.

### Summary

Bloomings are localized resonance spikes that catalyze Pattern manifestation.

### Lifecycle

1. Ambient Resonance Rise
2. Threshold Surge (pre-Bloom indicators)
3. Pattern Coalescence (Aetherbot emergence)
4. Stabilization or Fray Drift

### Environmental Correlates

| Site Type      | Rationale                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------- |
| Fault lines    | Energy stress differentials |
| Server farms   | Data emission harmonics     |
| Deep archives  | Dense semantic layering     |
| Meteor craters | Exotic mineral conduction   |

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "BloomingEvent",
  "phases": ["ambient", "surge", "coalescence", "resolution"],
  "outcomes": ["stabilized", "frayDrift"],
  "riskFactors": ["overstrain", "illicitExtraction"]
}
```

### Detection Signals

- Spectral aurora variation
- Thread noise amplitude increase

## Fray

Destabilization state when Loom interactions exceed safe thresholds or violate ethical constraints.

### Summary

Fray is systemic corruption degrading Pattern coherence and environmental stability.

### Escalation Tiers

| Tier | Indicator            | Impact                     |
| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| I    | Minor distortion     | Slight stat penalties      |
| II   | Thread fragmentation | Increased failure chance   |
| III  | Behavioral drift     | Technique unpredictability |
| IV   | Zone destabilization | Environmental hazards      |
| V    | Loom tear precursor  | Catastrophic risk          |

### Causes

- Overstrain of Co-Weaves
- Device Bind misuse
- Forced Pattern suppression

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "FrayState",
  "tiers": 5,
  "effectsProgressive": true,
  "recoveryModes": ["stabilizationRitual", "cooldown", "keystoneField"]
}
```

### Mitigation Strategies

| Strategy              | Mechanism                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Stabilization Ritual  | Gradual tier rollback      |
| Keystone Field (hyp.) | Passive decay acceleration |
| Consent Reset         | Re-aligns intent resonance |

---

## Keystone Patterns

Hypothesized stabilizer-class Patterns capable of repairing Loom integrity.

### Summary

Keystone Patterns are legendary, high-order Pattern entities believed to exert localized stabilizing influence over the Loom, counteracting Fray accumulation.

### Characteristics (Hypothesized)

| Attribute        | Expectation                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Rarity           | Extremely scarce                        |
| Thread Density   | Above conventional composite thresholds |
| Field Effect     | Passive Fray decay                      |
| Bond Requirement | Advanced maturation stage               |

### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "KeystonePattern",
  "stability": "theoretical",
  "predictedProperties": [
    "frayDecayField",
    "highThreadDensity",
    "conditionalActivation"
  ]
}
```

### Open Research Threads

- Do dual/braided anomalies correlate with proto-Keystones?
- Are site-bound Keystones linked to historical events?

## Why It Matters

Strategic framing: preventing a Loom Tear and enabling safe system evolution.

### Loom Stability Risk

Unchecked Fray escalation threatens structural collapse (a Tear) — a scenario with cascading narrative, mechanical, and data integrity implications.

### Strategic Objectives

| Objective                  | Description                    | Impact                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Identify Keystone Patterns | Locate & validate stabilizers  | Long-term mitigation  |
| Codify Semantics           | Align domain & lore terms      | Reduced drift         |
| Ethical Guardrails         | Prevent exploitative mechanics | Sustainability        |
| Progressive Simulation     | Model risk states early        | Preempt failure modes |

### Value to Stakeholders

| Stakeholder         | Benefit                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Players / Readers   | Coherent, evolving world       |
| Engineers           | Predictable data contracts     |
| Product             | Clear risk & roadmap alignment |
| Narrative Designers | Stable hooks & extensibility   |

### Success Indicators

- Declining Fray incident rate
- Consistent entity schema across API & docs
- Stable glossary (low churn in core terms)
