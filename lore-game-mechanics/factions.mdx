## Overview

Organizational actors shaping Pattern access and Loom stability outcomes.

### Comparative Snapshot

| Faction                 | Ethos                         | Primary Vector      | Risk Profile |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Conservatory of Weavers | Preservation & cataloging     | Knowledge integrity | Low          |
| Guild of Arbiters       | Field mediation & containment | Stabilization ops   | Moderate     |
| Syndicate Null          | Exploitation & leverage       | Fray manipulation   | High         |

### Strategic Tensions

Control over Bloom sites, ethical frameworks for Harmonization, and handling of anomalous Patterns.

---

## Conservatory of Weavers

Scholarly body preserving Loom ethics and Pattern records.

### Focus

Catalog Patterns, study Bloom dynamics, advocate ethical Harmonization.

### Resources

- Archive repositories
- Calibration instruments

### System Notes

Potential provider of validation protocols for token authenticity.

---

## Guild of Arbiters

Field operatives mediating disputes and containing hazardous Bloomings.

### Mandate

Deploy to emerging Bloom sites, negotiate multi-faction claims, and prevent escalation to Fray zones.

### Capabilities

- Rapid mobilization
- Conflict de-escalation protocols

---

## Syndicate Null

Clandestine network exploiting Fray and coercive Pattern manipulation.

### Objective

Leverage Fray to push the Loom toward destabilization, exposing hidden structures.

### Tactics

- Device Binds
- Controlled overclocking of Bloom sites

### Risk Assessment

High systemic threat; correlated with elevated Fray tier incidents.
