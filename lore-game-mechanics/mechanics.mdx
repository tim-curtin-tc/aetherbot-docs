### System Specification

```json
{
  "entity": "StatSet",
  "stats": ["Attack", "Defense", "Magic", "Focus", "Speed", "Resilience"],
  "scaling": "nonLinear"

## Status Effects

Deterministic transient conditions altering attribute or action states.

| Emberbrand | Damage over time    | Dampening        |
| Hush       | Magic lockout       | Resonant cleanse |
| Veil       | Evasion increase    | True sight       |
| Anchor     | Movement prevention | Disrupt field    |

  "entity": "StatusEffect",
  "effects": ["Tangle", "Static", "Emberbrand", "Hush", "Veil", "Anchor"],
  "counterRequired": true
}
```

## Techniques & Weaves

Active capability taxonomy including cooperative Weaves.

### Categories

| Category       | Description                     | Source             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Technique      | Standard active ability         | Individual Pattern |
| Co-Weave       | Bonded composite action         | Harmonized pair    |
| Ultimate Weave | High-cost keystone-level effect | Advanced bond      |

### Balancing Axes

{
  "entity": "Technique",
  "types": ["standard", "coWeave", "ultimate"],
  "cooldownModel": "variable"
}
```

## Fray Escalation

Procedural model for corruption tier advancement and rollback.

### Trigger Inputs

| Input                  | Effect on Tier Probability |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Consecutive Overstrain | Increases                  |
| Device Bind Exposure   | Strong increase            |
| Failed Consent Pulse   | Minor increase             |

### Decay Inputs

| Input                | Effect                   |

## Environmental Zones

Zone-level modifiers applying systemic effects.

| Zone Type           | Modifier                   | Risk                 |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |

## Progression & Scaling

Framework for controlled capability growth without runaway power.

### Axes

| Axis                  | Method              | Constraint          |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Bond Stage            | Narrative + usage   | Maturation criteria |
| Technique Tier Unlock | Experience / ritual | Cooldown cost rise  |
| Stat Growth           | Weighted allocation | Diminishing returns |

### Anti-Runaway Measures

- Non-linear stat curves
- Overstrain risk scaling with burst sequences

## Failure States

Defined negative outcomes enabling recovery mechanics and risk telegraphing.

| State              | Cause                         | Effect                | Recovery             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| Mis-Harmonization  | Intent mismatch               | Attenuated Techniques | Intent recalibration |
| Overstrain Lockout | Consecutive high-cost actions | Cooldown enforced     | Rest interval        |
| Fray Collapse      | Tier V escalation             | Systemic hazard       | Keystone / ritual    |

### Design Goal

Every failure state should expose a clear, teachable remediation path.
